* I used django_rest_framework during the project
* I used Sqlite database
* I created related models but I didn't create relationships between them, after I finished project I realized make them in a 1-* relationships could be beneficial for the performance

* I used Foursquare API with given api-key
* I crated seperate Fron-end & Back-end folders
* I added requirements.txt inside the backend folder.
* I added docstrings in methods
* Swagger documentation is added with localhost/swagger path
* I made with with my apitests with postman (not professional tests, I tried posting,getting data and checked status.codes)
* I used virtual env during the project
* I added a very basic design for show, How I approach the problem at the beginning
* I ran the front-end with npm run serve with Network: http://192.168.1.2:8080/ (in django.settings this URL whitelisted)

* I am not happy from my location_api.views location_record method. If you even give negative feedback about me, I will be glad if you give feedback & advices about reducing complexity. It is not working on Single-responsibility principle, have two responsibilities.
